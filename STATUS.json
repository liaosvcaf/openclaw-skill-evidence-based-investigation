  "notes": "OpenClaw-specific investigation methodology with no direct ClawHub competitors. Enterprise RCA tools (Algomox, Datagrid) target wrong domain. Key differentiators: decision-point analysis framework (novel), OpenClaw JSONL log patterns, evidence citation discipline. Synergistic with sess-diagnoser, sess-fixer, health-check portfolio. Recommend maintain with pattern additions as OpenClaw evolves."
